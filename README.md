# Katie Powell McKenzie Personal Website

This is a personal website for Katie Powell McKenzie. As a back end engineer I used a lot of bootstrap and templating tech to make this look better. The contact form on the page uses my (Email Api)[https://github.com/mmcken3/email-api] to send the messages to through text right now. In the future it will sent emails or both text and emails with it. 

*Still under development*
